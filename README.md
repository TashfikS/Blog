This is a ASP.Net based project where Angular was used as Front end & SSMS as database management system. In this project, user can see the multiple blogs of admin. Only Admin can create, update & delete any blog. To help user which blog would be fit for their reading, a pre-review version of tha blog will visualize first with title, summery & a detail button. With the help of the detail button, user can dive into the detail part of that blog.
